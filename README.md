To reproduce the analysis conducted in the thesis the following files must be run:
- SIMULATION_FINAL for the simulation
- EA_GDP for the empirical analysis of the GDP (EA_GDP.xlsx is the relative data set)
- EA_HICP for the empirical analysis of inflation (EA_HICP.xlsx is the relative data set)

All the other files contain notes and previous attempts which are not relevat.
